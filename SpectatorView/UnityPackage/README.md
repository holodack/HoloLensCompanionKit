These UnityPackages will import the spectator view code.

If using a numbered release, there will also be a UnityPackage for the archived minimum set of the HoloToolkit, and the matching External directory.

If using the latest HoloToolkit_master code, you will need to import the HoloToolkit from the master branch [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/HoloToolkit-Unity).
